Module 1 Challenge - Horiseon Refactor

In this challenge I completed several tasks so that this site is optimized for search engines. 

<ul>When the source code is viewed, it has semantic HTML elements.</ul> 
<ul>The structure of the HTML elements follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.</ul> 
<ul>Image elements have accessible alt attributes.</ul> 
<ul>Heading attributes fall in sequential order.</ul> 
<ul>The site has a concise, descriptive title.</ul>
